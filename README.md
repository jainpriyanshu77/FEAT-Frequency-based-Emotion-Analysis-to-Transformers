# FEAT: From Frequency-based Emotion Analysis to Transformers

This project explores advanced techniques in emotion classification using state-of-the-art transformer models and hybrid feature approaches. The main components include:

## Key Features

- Utilization of DistilRoBERTa and DistilBERT models
- Hybrid feature engineering combining transformer embeddings with TF-IDF
- Comparison of various machine learning classifiers (SVC, Random Forest, etc.)
- Ensemble learning techniques for improved performance

## Performance

The best-performing model achieves:
- Accuracy: 0.9501
- Macro F1 Score: 0.9174

## Dataset

The project uses the CARER dataset, which contains English Twitter messages categorized into six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

## Methodology

1. Fine-tuning transformer models
2. Extracting embeddings and combining with TF-IDF features
3. Training and evaluating various classifiers
4. Analyzing performance across different emotions

## Applications

This emotion classification system can be applied to various domains, including:

- Social media sentiment analysis
- Customer feedback processing
- Content moderation

## Ethical Considerations

The project addresses privacy protection and aims to mitigate risks of biased outcomes in emotion classification.
